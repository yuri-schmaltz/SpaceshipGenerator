# Spaceship Generator

A Blender script to procedurally generate 3D spaceships from a random seed.

Usage
-----
* Install Blender 2.80 or greater: http://blender.org/download/
* Download newest `add_mesh_SpaceshipGenerator.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/a1studmuffin/SpaceshipGenerator/releases) section
* Under Edit > Preferences... > Add-ons > Install... open the downloaded ZIP file
* Under Edit > Preferences... > Add-ons enable the "Add Mesh: Spaceship Generator" script (search for "spaceship")
* Add a spaceship in the 3D View under Add > Mesh > Spaceship
* Expand the Spaceship tab that appears in the bottom left of the viewport to adjust procedural generation settings

How it works

* Start with a box.
* Build the hull: Extrude the front/rear faces several times, adding random translation/scaling/rotation along the way.
* Add asymmetry to the hull: Pick random faces and extrude them out in a similar manner, reducing in scale each time.
* Add detail to the hull: Categorize each face by its orientation and generate details on it such as engines, antenna, weapon turrets, lights etc.
* Sometimes apply horizontal symmetry.
* Add a Bevel modifier to angularize the shape a bit.
* Apply materials to the final result.
* Take over the universe with your new infinite fleet of spaceships.

Extreme examples
----------------
The following screenshots were created using extreme values for the number of hull segments and asymmetry segments to show how the algorithm works.

Tips and Tricks
---------------
* By default the script deletes objects starting with `Spaceship` before generating a new one. To disable this behaviour simply remove the `reset_scene()` call in your own scripts.
* You can provide a seed to the `generate_spaceship()` function to always generate the same spaceship. For example:
  ```python
  import spaceship_generator
  spaceship_generator.generate_spaceship(random_seed="michael")
  ```
* The `generate_spaceship()` function takes many more parameters that affect the generation process. Try playing with them!
* You can replace the textures with your own ones. All textures are applied using global-space cube UVs. `hull_normal.png` is a normal map that adds extra surface "greebles". `hull_lights_diffuse.png` is an additive diffuse texture to set the color of the window lights. `hull_lights_emit.png` is an emissive texture to make the windows glow in darkness.
